Description: Fits flexible quasi-likelihood (FQL) generalized linear models
    for count data with heteroscedastic variance. The variance is modeled as
    an unknown smooth function of the mean, estimated nonparametrically via
    P-splines or kernel smoothing. This avoids distributional assumptions
    while properly accounting for overdispersion, making it particularly
    suitable for microbiome abundance count data. Methods are described in
    Shi et al. (2023) <doi:10.1002/sim.9880>.
